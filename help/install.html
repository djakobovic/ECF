<h1>ECF installation / running the examples</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Prerequisites &ndash; boost library</h2>
<p>ECF uses some features of <em>boost </em>C++ library (<a href="http://www.boost.org/">www.boost.org</a>). To use ECF, a minimal boost installation (only header files, no compilation) is needed. After the boost source files are extracted, the ECF projects may be compiled (on Windows, check the boost directory location!).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: in Visual Studio projects included in the ECF, <em>boost </em>include directory is set to "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_64_0". If you installed to a different location (or use a newer boost version), change the directory accordingly (in project's <em> Additional include directories</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining boost</strong>: the latest version can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.boost.org/users/download/"> https://www.boost.org/users/download/</a>.
For linux packages, be sure to search for 'libboost-dev' package (e.g. 'sudo apt-get install libboost-dev').</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>In the main directory you can find a "VS" subdirectory which contains Visual Studio solution file <strong>ECF_lib.sln.</strong> Open it and just build the solution (release and/or debug version). The solution produces library <em>ECF.lib </em>(in either ./<em>release </em>or ./<em>debug </em>directory) which can be used to build examples and user projects. Each example has its "VS" subdirectory with a VS solution file that can be used to build either debug or release version (having previously built the ECF_lib project).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>CMake</h3>
<p><a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>&nbsp;project files ("CMakeLists.txt") are provided in the main directory for the ECF library, and in example subfolders for each example.</p>

<h3>CLion</h3>
<p>The ECF library and the examples can also be compiled with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>, for which the project files are suplied in subdirectory .idea for each example.</p>
<p>Note: if you encounter CLion message "Error running 'Build': Cannot start process, the working directory '<ECF>\cmake-build-release' does not exist", reload the CMake project with Tools - CMake - Reload. </p>

<h3>Autotools (Linux)</h3>
<p><em>Semi-automatic </em>installation is available with this <a href="ecf_install.sh">nifty little script</a> (thanks to Jernej Makovsek), tested on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Otherwise, standard installation procedure applies (you may need to <em>chmod</em> the 'configure' script beforehand to be able to execute it):</p>
<pre> $ ./configure [ --prefix=DIR ]
 $ make
 $ make install</pre>
<p>By default, the compiled libraries are installed in folder '/usr/local/lib', while the headers are installed in '/usr/local/include'. <br /> You can specify a different installation folder by giving the option '<span style="font-family: Courier New;">--prefix=&lt;PATH&gt;</span>' to the 'configure' script, e.g. <span style="font-family: Courier New;">--prefix=/home/someuser/ecf/</span>.</p>
<p>Should any errors occurr, try reconfiguring the package by running <span style="font-family: Courier New;">aclocal</span>, <span style="font-family: Courier New;">autoconf</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New;">automake</span>&nbsp; (or just <span style="font-family: Courier New;">autoreconf -fi</span>) before ./<span style="font-family: Courier New;">configure</span>.</p>
<p>Each directory in /examples contains a Makefile used to build a specific example:</p>
<pre> $ cd examples/GAonemax
 $ make
 g++ -Wall OneMaxEvalOp.cpp -c -o OneMaxEvalOp.o
 g++ -Wall main.cpp -c -o main.o
 g++ -Wall OneMaxEvalOp.o main.o -lecf -o onemax</pre>
<p>If necessary, modify the Makefile to include the ECF installation library directory as the compilation flags (if not installed to the default system location), e.g.:</p>
<pre>CFLAGS = $(WARN) -I/home/someuser/ecf/include
LDFLAGS = $(WARN) -lecf -L/home/someuser/ecf/lib</pre>
<p>Make sure libecf is installed and can be found by the linker (add the above installation library directory defined with <span style="font-family: Courier New;">./configure</span> to LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary, e.g. '<span style="font-family: Courier New;">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>').</p>
<p>Each example is started by calling its name and given parameters file (e.g. "./onemax parameters.txt"). The examples and parameters are explained in more detail in the <a href="tutorial.html"><strong>Tutorial</strong></a>.</p>
