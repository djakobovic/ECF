<h1>7. Parallel ECF</h1>
<p>To use parallelization, the framework must be compiled with MPI library 
enabled (see <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a>).</p>
<p>When using parallel version of ECF, some additional components are available 
which are described below. To run parallel ECF in more processes, you need to 
start it with the installed MPI implementation.<br>
Running ECF in parallel is possible regardless of the choice of genotypes 
(individual structure) or, for some parallelization methods, of the algorithm 
used.</p>
<h2 CLASS="western">Parallel algorithms</h2>
<p CLASS="western">Parallel algorithms operate on a <i>single deme</i> and may 
be run in more than one process (see below for multiple demes parallel models). 
Currently supported parallel algorithms are:</p>
<pre STYLE="background: #ccccff url('')"><font color="#000000">&lt;Algorithm&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-- should be only one inside --&gt;
	&lt;AlgSGenGPEA&gt; &lt;!-- synchronous generational global parallel EA --&gt;
		&lt;Entry key=&quot;crxprob&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- crossover rate --&gt;
		&lt;Entry key=&quot;selpressure&quot;&gt;10&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- selection pressure: how much the best individual is 'better' than the worst --&gt;
		&lt;Entry key=&quot;jobsize&quot;&gt;5&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- number of individuals sent for evaluation to a worker process --&gt;
	&lt;/AlgSGenGPEA&gt;

	&lt;AlgAEliGPEA&gt; &lt;!-- asynchronous steady-state global parallel EA --&gt;
		&lt;Entry key=&quot;tsize&quot;&gt;3&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- tournament size --&gt;
		&lt;Entry key=&quot;jobsize&quot;&gt;5&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- number of individuals sent for evaluation to a worker process --&gt;
	&lt;/AlgAEliGPEA&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/Algorithm&gt;</font></pre>
<h2 CLASS="western">Implicit parallelization</h2>
<p CLASS="western"><i>NOTE: this section is still under development.</i></p>
<p CLASS="western">Implicit parallelization uses a <i>sequential </i>algorithm, 
but the user may state what parts of the algorithm should be executed in 
parallel. Currently these parts are parallelizable:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p CLASS="western"><b>evaluation</b>: individuals to be evaluated are sent 
	to worker processes and fitness is returned to the master</p></li>
	<li>
	<p CLASS="western"><b>mutation</b>: individuals to be mutated are mutated <i>
	and evaluated</i> at worker processes and then returned to the master</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="western">The only thing needed to use implicit paralleization is 
setting the following Registry options:</p>
<pre STYLE="background: #ccccff url('')"><font color="#000000">&lt;Entry key=&quot;parallel.type&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- implicit parallelization method: eval - evaluation, mut - mutation + eval --&gt;
&lt;Entry key=&quot;parallel.jobsize&quot;&gt;10&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- implicit parallelization jobsize (individuals per job) --&gt;</font></pre>
<p CLASS="western">This kind of parallelization is <i>asynchronous</i> because 
the algorithm may use (incomplete) individuals that are still not returned from 
the workers. <br>
ECF also offers the <i>synchronous</i> implicit parallelelization: in this mode 
the affected individuals are temporarily <i>removed</i> from the population, 
until they are returned to the master. Synchronicity is controlled with the 
following parameter in the Registry:</p>
<pre STYLE="background: #ccccff url('')">&lt;Entry key=&quot;parallel.sync&quot;&gt;1&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- implicit parallelization synchronicity: 0 - async, 1 - sync (default: 0) --&gt;</pre>
<p CLASS="western">Of course, although a sequential algorithm is used, these 
options are valid only with parallel ECF version.</p>
<p CLASS="western">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 CLASS="western">Multiple deme population</h2>
<p>The above algorithms distribute only the fitness evaluation between different 
processes, and are therefore most suitable for problems with complex fitness 
evaluation. If this is not the case, then distributing <i>the population </i>in 
several <i>demes</i> (subpopulations, islands) usually yields better results in 
terms of speedup and convergence.</p>
<p>To use multiple deme population in ECF, you need to set the parameter &quot;<i>population.demes</i>&quot; 
in the Registry block to more than 1 (which is the default value). For example:</p>
<pre STYLE="background: #ccccff url('')"><font COLOR="#000000">&lt;Entry key=&quot;population.size&quot;&gt;50&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- number of individuals (default: 100) --&gt;
&lt;Entry key=&quot;population.demes&quot;&gt;4&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- number of demes (default: 1) --&gt;</font></pre>
<p>In the above setting, the population consists of 4 demes with <i>each deme 
containing</i> 50 individuals.</p>
<p>Each deme currently runs the same algorithm (stated in the Algorithm XML 
block). Note that the demes may run the sequential <i>as well as parallel 
algorithms</i>; in the latter case, the parallel algorithm operates only within 
each deme (i.e. it does not 'see' other demes by default).</p>
<h2 CLASS="western">The migration operator</h2>
<p>Multiple demes do not make much difference by themselves if there is no 
communication between the subpopulations - that's where the migration operator 
steps in. The migration operator can copy some individuals from a deme into 
another deme, depending on the user parameters. Currently supported parameters 
for migration are the following (stated in the Registry block):</p>
<pre STYLE="background: #ccccff url('')"><font COLOR="#000000">&lt;Entry key=&quot;migration.freq&quot;&gt;10&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- individuals are exchanged each 'freq' generations (default: none) --&gt;
&lt;Entry key=&quot;migration.number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/Entry&gt; &lt;!-- number of individuals to be sent to another deme --&gt;</font></pre>
<p>The migration operator is <i>not</i> active unless you set the <i>
migration.freq </i>parameter. Additional migration properties are currently set 
as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>migration occurs each '<i>migration.freq</i>' generations (for all the 
	demes)</li>
	<li>individuals chosen for migration: the best one and additional random 
	ones (up to '<i>migration.number</i>')</li>
	<li>deme sending structure: ring (each deme sends its individuals to the 
	following deme with index + 1)</li>
	<li>individuals chosen for replacement at recepient deme: random except the 
	best individual</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: multiple deme population and migration operator can also be 
employed with the <i>sequential ECF</i>, where one process evolves all the demes 
in sequence.</p>
<h2 CLASS="western">The ECF parallel models</h2>
<p>Combining the previous components, ECF offers the following parallel 
combinations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>single deme, sequential algorithm - sequential EA</li>
	<li>single deme, parallel algorithm - global parallel EA</li>
	<li>single deme, implicitly parallel algorithm - global parallel EA</li>
	<li>multiple demes, sequential algorithm - distributed EA<ul>
		<li>in this setting, the number of MPI processes must equal the number 
		of demes stated in the configuration file!</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>multiple demes, parallel algorithm - hybrid distributed EA<ul>
		<li>in this setting, the number of processes must be <i>equal or greater</i> 
		than the number of demes, but should be greater for the parallel 
		algorithm to make sense</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>multiple demes, implicitly parallel algorithm - hybrid distributed EA</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of the algorithm and migration parameters will depend mostly on 
the problem at hand and parallel environment (the machines) the algorithm is run 
on.</p>
